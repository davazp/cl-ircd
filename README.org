* cl-ircd

  cl-ircd is a simple /IRC server/ written in Common Lisp. It is very
  far from complete and it is mostly useless, but if you find some
  reason to use it or improve it, feel free to do it.

  It depends on:
  - [[http://common-lisp.net/project/usocket/][usocket]]
  - [[http://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads/][bordeaux-threads]]
      
  Once you have install the dependencies, load the /cl-ircd/
  system. It provides you a /IRCD/ package. You can lunch the server
  on the default port 6667 wit
